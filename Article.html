              <p>
                The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered will reportedly get a PC port soon, which will be announced next month. This is according to Twitter user Silknigth, who recently leaked the announcement of Ghost of Tsushima's own PC port
                ahead of time. While their latest claim that The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered will launch on PC is far from confirmed, Silknigth has a good track record, also leaking the day that Xbox's ports to PlayStation and Switch were
                announced. According to Silknigth, this latest PC port will be unveiled next month, not long after the remaster launched on PS5.

              <p>
                The Ghost of Tsushima PC release date is set for Thursday, May 16, 2024. Sony is bringing the Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut version over to the Steam and Epic Game Store, giving players access to the Iki Island expansion
                and the multiplayer game mode, Legends.The port is being developed by Nixxes Software, a studio that was purchased by Sony back in 2021 to bring first-party PlayStation games to PC. Not every Sony first-party port has been
                perfect, like The Last of Us Part 1 Remastered which saw Naughty Dog issue an apology, but the games released by Nixxes have generally been well received by critics. The last game ported to PC by Nixxes was Ratchet & Clank:
                Rift Apart which utilized Windows 11 Direct Storage for seamless loading.

                According to insider Dusk Golem, Resident Evil 9 is being built on the open-world functionality of the RE Engine that was first utilized for Dragon's Dogma 2. Monster Hunter Wild is reportedly another open-world game on the
                RE Engine. Capcom apparently greenlights its projects in groups of three, so Resident Evil 7, Resident Evil 2 remake, and Devil May Cry 5 were reportedly approved close to each other to take advantage of the RE Engine. So
                when looking to expand the RE Engine's capabilities to create open-world games, Capcom reportedly greenlit Dragon's Dogma 2, Monster Hunter Wild, and Resident Evil 9.
